# Dashboard built for Roga Analytics

Our client was an American social service agency that required help in organizing the active tasks for their care managers. This complex dashboard featured multiple pages with dynamic views and a unique password system based on Microsoft SharePoint, bypassing the need for more than Power BI Service accounts. The details of the dashboard have been blurred for the sake of the clientâ€™s privacy.
